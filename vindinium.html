<h2>What is Vindinium?</h2>
 </body>
      Vindinium is basically an Al (Artificial Intelligence) programming game made up of coding. The objective of the game is to gain more gold than the other bots. The bots are the players. By making different functions for your bot, such as finding taverns and attacking when your bot has a certain number of health, the coding allows your bot to do specific actions. At the end of the game, whichever bot has the most number of gold wins.

<h2>Breaking Down The Coding</h2>
<body>
    <h3>Setting Up My Bot</h3>
The first step I took into creating my bot for the vindinium was by going to vindinium.org. I clicked on "Create New Bot" and I named my bot using my first name and an adjective to describe the bot. After submitting the name (Stefanie_CoolBot) and getting registered, I was given a secret key that I would keep to myself. I put the name of my bot in line 10 as a comment and the key in line 4 as a variable: var bot.

<br></br>
    <h3>Code That Describes WHAT To Do</h3>
Once I got my bot ready, I made a code that described exactly what I want my bot to do. Since one of functions I needed my bot to do was find taverns, I made a variable and conditional statements to describe when I wanted my bot to get to the taverns. I made a variable and named it "var task" and defined in an if statement that I wanted my bot to search for the taverns whenever my bot had a health of greater than 20. I coded it as "if (bot.yourBot.life < 20)". Below that I defined the task as "find nearest taverns". Then, I made an else if statement to say that if my bot's life had a health of more than 50, it would attack the closest player. I also had my bot find the distance to the nearest bot with a low health of lower than 20. I made another task below that statement and set it equal to "attack nearest enemyBot". Afterwards, I made one last statement, an else stantement, that defined in a task that if the health was between 20 an 50, that my bot would search for freemines. Above the variable and conditional statements for what my bot would do, I added a comment that helped me remember what and when the coding they was supposed to be used.

<h2>Why I Did What I Did</h2>
<body>
    I decided to make my bot altogether be able to the find nearest taverns, be able to attack the nearest enemyBots, and __________.

<h2>AI Reflection</h2>
<body>
    After coding my bot, it was always able to do everything I wanted it to do. When my bot had health less than 20, it search for taverns. When my bot had a health of more than 50, it searched for the nearest enemyBot to attack. When my bot had any health between 20 and 50, it searched for freemines. Overall, the coding I need in order to make my bot function this way was somewhat confusing and complicated for me to do. I was still having trouble understanding the purpose and how to use conditional statements, which were a very essencial part in making my bot work the way it does. My understanding and opinion has changed of AI from writing my own because now I better understand how to use and form different conditional statements. I now feel more comfortable and that I may be able to succed in creating conditional statements.
