<h2>Purpose</h2>
 </body>
     The purpose of this page is to help you understand each part of a computer and what each part does.

<h2>Motherboard</h2>
<body>
   The motherboard is one of the main parts of a computer system. It holds together many parts of a computer, including the CPU, memory, and connectors. A motherboard also contains sub-systems. It is basically the "mother" of all the components.  Motherboards are also present in other everyday items too, such as cell phones, clocks, and watches.

<h2>CPU</h2>
<body>
    The CPU, which stands for Central Processing Unit, is simply the "brains" of a computer, it's where most calculations take place. It is the most essential part of a computer program because it includes instructions for it. A CPU refers to its processing  and control unit, which identifies important elements from other parts.

<h2>RAM</h2>
</body>
    The Random Access Memory or RAM, is the computer's memory. It can access any memory cell. There are two main types of a RAM, which are: DRAM and SRAM. A DRAM, Dynamic Random Access Memory, is a physical memory that needs to be refreshed, otherwise everything inside would go missing. Whereas the SRAM, static random access memory, does not need to be refreshed, therefore it is the more reliable type of RAM of the two and it is even faster than the DRAM, making it more expensive.

<h2>Hard Drive</h2>
<body>
  A hard drive is a storage area for your data where all your files and folders are located. It was invented in the 1950's by Reynold B. Johnson, an American inventor and computer engineer. He invented it along with the International Business Machines Corporation, also known as the IBM, which is an American multinational technology company. At first, hard drives used to be about the size of a refrigerator, but ever since then, they have been shrinking in size, becoming smaller and smaller.

<h2>Keyboard</h2>
</body>
   A keyboard is panel of keys used to enter characters and functions in a computer. The reason the letters on the keys are not in alphabetical order is to prevent mechanical jams, so the frequently used letters are spread out. The first keyboard (Qwerty) was invented by an American inventor named Christopher Latham Sholes in 1868, along with Frank Haven Hall, Samuel W. Soule, Carlos Gladden, and John Pratt.

<h2>Computer Mouse</h2>
<body>
  A computer mouse is a hand-operated device with two buttons and a scroll wheel used to control a computer. It was invented in 1964 by Douglas Engelbart. It was named a "mouse" because of the way it looked like a mouse when it was connected to a computer.

<h2>How do the different components communicate with one another?</h2>
<body>
    Different components communicate with one another through the computer bus. The computer bus is a communication system that moves data between components inside or between computers.
